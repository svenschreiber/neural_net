# Todo List

General:
- [x] proper time querying

Rendering/Visualization:
- [x] shaders
- [x] drawing quads
- [x] drawing simple circles
- [x] drawing lines
- [x] support the option for outlines
- [x] visualization of the network
- [ ] draw neuron activations (as text)
- [ ] make the camera controllable
- [ ] make 28x28 paintable grid to draw some numbers

Neural Network:
- [x] basic neuron setup
- [x] forward propagation
- [x] back-propagation
- [x] input data loading
- [x] neuron bias
- [ ] shuffle training set?
- [x] use ReLU activation function
- [x] remove num_weights_per_neuron because its repetitive?
- [ ] change the raw malloc arrays to polymorphic arrays
- [ ] add the ability to save/load weights
- [x] try network on mnist handwritten
- [ ] support multi class and binary classification at the same time (with organized code)
- [x] use momentum

MNIST Loader:
- [x] load test/training set
- [ ] make api better
- [ ] cleanup code

Math:
- [ ] extend matrix math implementation
