# Simple Neural Network

This repository contains a simple (and my first) implementation of a neural network. The program is written in Prometheus, an unreleased jai-like programming language. 
OpenGL is used to visualize the learning progress of the neural network.

Because the programming language is not finished, there are lots of little hacks and fiddly syntax.

To test the neural network I implemented a simple [MNIST](https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) classifier and drawing grid to predict self-drawn numbers.
