# Simple Neural Network

This repository contains a simple (and my first) implementation of a neural network. The program is written in Prometheus, an unreleased jai-like programming language, that is made by a friend of mine. 

- OpenGL is used to visualize the learning progress of the neural network.
- FreeType is used to load and render font glyphs.

Because the programming language is not finished, there are lots of little hacks and fiddly syntax situations.

To test the neural network I implemented a simple [MNIST](https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) classifier and a 28x28 drawing grid to predict self-drawn numbers.
